# My Apache Kafka Getting Started Practice project

## Introduction

I am using this repository to practice using the Apache Kafka platform to build Distributed Systems. 
Follow along and join my journey to the complexities of Distributed Systems...

# Getting Started Project Overview

The getting started project is a system that simulates a client computer making say sales requests, a messaging service 
serving these requests to be processed and responding to the client computer that prints some desired output

```java
public class Messages {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        System.out.println("Let us use Apache Kafka to build distributed systems!")
    }
}

//some code
